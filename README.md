# Phisics-Engine

This repository is going to implement a simple physics engine for 2D point mechanics. I am going to use the Euler-Richardson algorithm (RK2) for simplicity. The simple animation is going to go on the browser canvas. The project is going to be part of a mathematics-physics training project for elementary and seconday school pupils.
